This was a project for my 2nd year, 2nd semester subject "Programming techniques".

The given task was to write an application that is used in a restaurant to manage orders: three types of user must be taken into account - the administrator that can edit the restaurant menu, the waiter that can accept customers' orders and the chef that must be notified of what dishes he needs to cook next.

The complete task description can be seen in the _HW4_Task.pdf_ file, while the exact grading criteria are in the _HW4_Grading.pdf_ file.

A more detailed description of the project, the employed classes, design patterns used, use-cases covered, assumptions made and so on can be found in the _Assignment 4 Documentation.pdf_ file.
